Description: Estimate a suite of normalizing transformations, including 
    a new technique based on ranks which can guarantee normally distributed 
    transformed data if there are no ties: ordered quantile normalization. 
    The package is built to estimate the best normalizing transformation for
    a vector consistently and accurately. It implements the Box-Cox 
    transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation, three types of Lambert
    WxF transformations, and the ordered quantile normalization 
    transformation.
