#' bestNormalize: Flexibly calculate the best normalizing transformation for a vector
#'
#' The foo package provides several normalizing tranformations, and introduces a new transformation based
#' off of the order statistics, \code{orderNorm}. Perhaps the most useful function is 
#' \code{bestNormalize}, which attempts all of these transformations and picks the best one 
#' based off of a goodness of fit statistic.
